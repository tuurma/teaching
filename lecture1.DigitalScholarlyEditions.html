        <section><h2>At the heart of the edition: the text</h2>
          <blockquote> “What is text? I am not so naïve as to imagine that question could ever be
            finally settled. Asking such a question is like asking ‘How long is the coast of
            England?’.”(J. McGann)</blockquote>
          <blockquote> “Text is what you look at. And how you look at it.” (P. Sahle)</blockquote>
          <blockquote>A lot of this talk is based on the work of Patrick Sahle, Elena Pierazzo,
            Georg Vogeler, Franz Fisher, the IDE, DiXiT, and RIDE amongst others.</blockquote>

            an ample margin; this is not so much through any love of the thing in itself, however
            agreeable, as for the facility it affords me of penciling in suggested thoughts,
            agreements, and differences of opinion, or brief critical comments in general.” </blockquote>

          <h2>critical representation of historical documents</h2>
          <p>"historical documents": editing is concerned with documents that already exist. To
            publish a new document (which doesn't refer to something preexisting) is not scholarly
            editing. </p>
          <p>"representation": covers (abstract) representation as well as presentation
            (reproduction). Publishing descriptive data (e.g. metadata) without reproduction is not
            critical editing. A catalogue, a database, a calendar is not an edition.</p>
          <p>"critical / scholarly": reproduction of documents without critical examination is not
            scholarly editing. A facsimile is not a scholarly edition. </p>

          <p>digital != digitized</p>
          <p>A digital edition can not be printed without a loss of information and/or
            functionality. The digital edition is guided by a different paradigm. If the paradigm of
            an edition is limited to the two-dimensional space of the "page" and to typographic
            means of information representation, then it's not a digital edition.</p>
          <blockquote>Digital scholarly editions are not just scholarly editions in digital
            media.</blockquote>
        </section>
        <section><h2>The 'digital' enhancements</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>scope: volume makes the print version impractical or impossible</li>
            <li>linked data: extensive use of
              pointers to linked material on-site or elsewhere</li>
            <li>searches: full-text search
              with pattern matching, context aware search</li>
            <li>visualisations: timelines,
              maps, graphs, word-clouds, topic-extraction...</li>
            <li>linguistic analysis</li>
            <li>facsimiles: hi-quality
              images, zooming, zone-level annotation</li>

            <li>Guidelines for reviewing
              SDE's are based on our traditions of print editions and the 'digital incunabula' we've
              seen so far. As such, any guidelines are a moving and developing
              target. Many questions are still
              under discussion.</li>
            <li>Best practices in digital
              editing have been established for many editorial tasks. </li>

              disseminate and canonize approved methods and approaches. </li>

              they should take.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Electronic
              scholarly editions should be accessible to the broadest audience possible. They should
              not require a particular type of computer, or a particular piece of software:
              unnecessary technical barriers to their use should be avoided.</blockquote>

              obsolete.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Printed scholarly
              editions have developed their current forms in order to meet both intellectual
              requirements and to adapt to the characteristics of print publication. Electronic
              editions must meet the same intellectual needs. There is no reason to abandon
              traditional intellectual requirements merely because we are using a different medium

              many conventions or requirements of traditional print editions reflect not the demands
              of readers or scholarship, but the difficulties of conveying complex information on
              printed pages without confusing or fatiguing the reader, or the financial exigencies
              of modern scholarly publishing. Such requirements need not be taken over at all, and

              without apparatus, without documentation of editorial principles, and without decent
              provision for suitable display are equally unacceptable for serious scholarly
              work.</blockquote>

            critical apparatus for the documentation of textual variance, or to select a particular
            perspective during the transcription. Hence, there are only three necessary conditions
            for an SDE: <ul>
              <li>Be scholarly: a
                justification of the editorial method; clear description of the principles of the
                edition,</li>
              <li>Compliance with scholarly
                requirements towards content and quality, which includes that the self-stated rules
                are followed, and editions acts as a surrogate for the original as much as
                possible</li>
              <li>Follow a 'digital
                paradigm': i.e. editorial concept that is not restricted to the technological
                limitations of print technology</li>
